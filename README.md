# TP1 Crypto Engineering
Implementing  a simple, yet effective key-recovery attack on a reduced
version of the AES. This attack (taking the many names of “square”, “‘saturation” or
“integral” attack) is structural, in the sense that it does not depend on many details
of the AES, but rather on its overall SPN structure.

You can also find test if the function when running the q1,q2,q3 files.

## Compilation:

 ```sh
   make
   ```

## Running files:
```sh
./q1
./q2
./q3
```

## cleaning the project:
```sh
make clean
```
